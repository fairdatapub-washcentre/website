# The Opportunity {background-color="#4C326A"}

::: {.notes}

- We have a huge and missed opportunity in our sector
- Very little data is shared publicly and following best practices for reuse

:::

## Journal articles

:::

::: {.notes}
- The first missed opportunity are journal articles and data from researchers

- We looked at the Data Availability Statements in 924 articles published in the Journal of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene for Development from 2011 to 2023.

- You can see the data availability statements on the vertical axis and the number of publications on the horizontal axis

- Colors differentiate between papers published before 2020 and in 2020 or later, when a policy was introduced that requires authors to select one of the three data availability statements

- After that policy was introduced, we still found 15% of papers without a data availability statement, while 60% of articles stated that data was available in the paper, which could also be as supplementary material

:::

## Journal articles {.smaller}

#### Supplementary Material

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

[Take-away]{.highlight-yellow}: Not a single file is in [machine-readable]{.highlight-yellow}, [non-proprietary]{.highlight-yellow} file type format that would qualify for following FAIR principles for data sharing [@wilkinson2016].

[Good practice]{.highlight-yellow}: CSV file (comma-separated values), including a data dictionary for all variables/columns in the data
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
```{r}

tbl_supp_type |> 
    gt() |> 
    tab_header(title = "Supplementary Material",
               subtitle = "Articles published 2020 or later") |>
    tab_style(locations = cells_column_labels(), 
              style = cell_text(weight = "bold")) |>
    fmt_number(columns = c(perc), decimals = 1) |> 
    cols_label(supp_file_type = "file type", n = "n", perc = "%") |> 
    tab_footnote(
        footnote = md("One article can have multiple files."),
        locations = cells_column_labels(columns = n)
        )

```

- We then looked at the Supplementary Material of all articles published in 2020 or later and found that have half of the published articles still had no data published alongside the article

- But, the most insightful take-away is that not a single file was shared in a file type format that would qualify for following FAIR principles for data sharing.

- That is something we are hoping to change, where sharing data as CSV files would already go a long way.

# openwashdata publishing {background-color="#4C326A"}

We are doing this through our openwashdata publishing arm, for which we developed a workflow that uses data donated by WASH professionals or available online, and re-publishes it following FAIR principles for data sharing

::: {.notes}
- The product is an R package published as a website for each dataset. We assign a digital object identifier that enables the tracking of citations of the data package and list all contributors with their ORCID iD, so that contributions and citations are linked.

- Data is documented in a way where all variables/columns are described in detail.

- And for those who do not use R, we also share the data as a CSV and XLSX file.

- To date, we have published 12 datasets following this workflow.

## openwashdata academy

-   10-week free data science course to empower WASH professionals to engage with tools and workflows for open data
-   200 registrations from 46 countries
-   27 datasets submitted as final projects

# How can we streamline the data publishing procedure? {background-color="#4C326A"}

## `washr`

-   An R package designed to simplify WASH data publishing
-   User-friendly functions to ensure that data adheres to FAIR principles
-   Preparation of a detailed guide and workflow visualization

[**So far:**]{style="color:#679289;"}

- Almost a dozen datasets published 
- Requires minimal computational power
- Easily generalizable to benefit the wider community

::: notes
-   Standardize as much as possible
-   Components: R(Studio), Git(Hub), Quarto
-   Provide a few functions to illustrate
:::

## 

![](img/lec-02/workflow.png)

## Preparing the data

-   Start a local (Posit Cloud for us) version-controlled folder, connect it to GitHub

![](img/lec-02/repos.png){style="border: 2px solid black;" fig-align="center"}

## Preparing the data

-   `setup_rawdata()`
    -   Creates `data-raw` as suggested in `usethis` R Package[^1]
    -   Creates `data_processing.R` for data cleaning

[^1]: See [https://usethis.r-lib.org/](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/)

![](img/lec-02/datapreparation.png){style="border: 2px solid black;" fig-align="center"}

## Documenting the data

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Create roxygen skeletons
-   Create README
-   Codebook describing each variable
-   Website with `pkgdown` R package[^2]
-   Add a license and author(s)
