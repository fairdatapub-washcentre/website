# Version Control {background-color="#4C326A"}

## Version Control with Git and GitHub

A way to share files with others, so they can:

-   download
-   re-use
-   contribute

You can view the history of files, and jump back in time to any point.

## Why is it useful?

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/lec-01/phd_comics_vc.gif")
```

## Git and GitHub

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="25%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/lec-01/git-logo.png")
```

-   Git is a software for version control
-   Created in 2005
-   Popular among programmers collaboratively developing code
-   Tracks changes in a set of files (directory/folder/repository)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="25%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/lec-01/github-logo.png")
```

-   GitHub is a hosting platform for version control using Git

-   Launched in 2008, aquired by Microsoft in in 2018, Microsoft for US\$ 7.5 billion

-   > 100 million Users (20.5 in 2022 alone) ([October, 2023](https://octoverse.github.com/2022/global-tech-talent))

-   Social media for software developers
